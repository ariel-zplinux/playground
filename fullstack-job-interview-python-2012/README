	http://www.acmesystems.it/python_httpserver


To transfer parameters, the ajax version is using POST while the non-ajax is using GET.

Unicode in python is not working at this stage, I've prefered to focus on the ajax part.

For the http status code, 404 (not found) is blue, all other status (error) are red

It's a working version, not really a clean or an optimized one.
I could (and probably will) make it cleaner, more stable and more optimized with more time.

I've attached my original "work plan" document.

List of files:

	test_ror.py
	test_ror.js
	index.html
	structure.css
	database.conf
	README
	INSTALL
	workplan.jpg

To run it (in the directory where all files are):

	python test_ror.py

The port can be passed as an argument (ie: python test_ror.py 8080)
Without argument it's 8000 per default. 


After you can open http://localhost:8000 in a web browser.

It has been checked with Python 2.7.3rc2 (Debian Testing).
